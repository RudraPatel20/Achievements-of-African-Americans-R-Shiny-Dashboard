.pull-right[

- Purpose: To analyze the year wise achievements of the African-Americans. 
- Lack of description
- Need for approximation of count for each category
- Scale on X axis is inappropriate as it has large year gap. 
- Confusing color selection leading to a mix-up in categories
- Difficulty in interpretation for a person who does not have an analytical background
- Non- Interactive

# Aim for Modifications

- To make the graph more interactive and user-friendly

- To obtain maximum information from the graph with minimum number of clicks

- Ensuring that the viewers receive a brief description on the data they want to analyze

- Preventing the mix-up of categories in order to calculate the exact count

TheÂ first achievements by African AmericansÂ in various fields historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change. The shorthand phrase for this isÂ *"breaking the color barrier."*Â <br/>*~[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_firsts)*
